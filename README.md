OGG Vorbis decoder ported to Dart
=================================
An attempt at porting https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_vorbis.c to pure Dart. This is mostly intended as a way to learn about the OGG container format and Vorbis audio codec. I only ported a small part so far, but maybe I will continue one day.
